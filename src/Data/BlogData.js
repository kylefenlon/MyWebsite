        'description': `In March 2024, I was invited to speak at the monthly 'Tech Meetup - Glasgow.' 
                        The main focus of my talk was how my 'quarter-life crisis' led me into software 
                        development and how I successfully secured a job in a challenging market for juniors.

                        During the talk, I shared my journey from learning to code on my own to joining a bootcamp. 
                        I discussed the eight months I spent applying my new skills by building projects while 
                        working two other jobs and dedicating one day a week to a free software placement. Explaining 
                        throughout the talk how these efforts led me to secure my first job in the industry.`,

        'challenges': `This was an axiety inducing challenge that made me uncomfortable just at the thought of
                        speaking in front of an audience - not due to the literal act of doing it - but rather
                        speaking in front of a group of people who are way ahead me in terms of software
                        experience and just life in general.
                        
                        Dealing with the ruminating thoughts of imposter syndrome, asking myself 'why would anyone
                        listen to a junior who has less than a years experience in this industry.' A combination
                        of all the things listed made me uncomfortable which is why I felt like I had to do it. The
                        reward on the other side of facing something uncomfortable is worth it as you grow from it.`,
